# Malware Analysis
This notebook automates the initial stages of malware triage.

## Setup
From the `malware-analysis` directory, enter:
```
jupyter notebook
```

## TODO
- [ ] Robust Reporting
  - [ ] Findings written to log file
    - [ ] Sample name
    - [ ] Hash values
    - [ ] StringSifter measurements 
- [ ] Upload widget
- [ ] SSDeep Fuzzy Hashing (requires apt dependencies so may not be a good fit)
- [ ] "Windows Shopping" No sample on hand? Calls to Malware Bazaar API for a recently submitted sample.

## Version 0.3 | "Module system - malware-analysis"
- [x] The user can create complex external modules and process the samples with these modules.
- Modules
  - How to create a module?

  The user must create a file "ExampleModule.py" inside the modules folder, then create a class called ExampleModule and define a run method such that:
  ```python
	def run(self, sample_path, saved_sample_name):
		pass
  ```

  In this way, the run method receives the necessary malware samples and paths, and the user can build a custom module for them.
  - How to execute a module? 

	User only needs to call MalwareSample.mod_loader("ExampleModule", sample_path, saved_sample_name)

## Version 0.2 | "The Hand That Strikes"
We are now cooking on an induction stovetop.

- [x] Malware defanged
- [x] StringSifter for ML ranking of extracted strings
- [x] Specimen saved in standard convention `[MalwareType].[Name].[TrueExtension].[DefangedExtension]`
- [x] Archives sample, log output, password file, and other info into date stamped dir in `saved-specimens` in password-protected zip file, password 'infected'

## Version 0.1 | The "It's A Start" Update
- [x] Drop malware into dropbox
- [x] Hashes taken 
- [x] VT analysis (requires API key)


## WNI
- FLOSS output (dependency adding issue w/ poetry, supplanted by StringSifter)
